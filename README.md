# Auto-Follower
A person-following framework for urban Ackermann human-machine collaborative robotics. Auto-Follower comprises three main modules: Vision-LiDAR Servo Tracker (VLST), local mapping, and a navigation module based on the Iterative Radius Points Search(IRPS) method. Experiments in both urban environments and laboratories have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our framework. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework, with its superior perception capabilities, achieves robust person-following performance and generalizes well across different robot types and application scenarios.
